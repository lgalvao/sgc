# Quality Improvement Plan

This document outlines a plan to improve the quality of the frontend codebase based on the results of the FTA (Fast TypeScript Analyzer) tool.

## Files to Refactor

The following files have been identified as having the lowest quality scores and should be prioritized for refactoring:

1.  `stores/__tests__/processos.spec.ts` (FTA Score: 68.07)
2.  `components/__tests__/Navbar.spec.ts` (FTA Score: 60.04)
3.  `router.ts` (FTA Score: 58.40)
4.  `stores/__tests__/configuracoes.spec.ts` (FTA Score: 55.79)
5.  `services/subprocessoService.ts` (FTA Score: 55.10)

## Refactoring Steps

### 1. `stores/__tests__/processos.spec.ts`

*   **Issue:** High complexity and number of lines.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Break down large tests into smaller, more focused `it` blocks.
    *   Group related tests using `describe` blocks.
    *   Extract repetitive setup code into `beforeEach` hooks.
    *   Use helper functions for common assertions.

### 2. `components/__tests__/Navbar.spec.ts`

*   **Issue:** High complexity.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Simplify assertions by using custom matchers or helper functions.
    *   Isolate tests to check for one specific behavior at a time.
    *   Mock child components to reduce the scope of the test.

### 3. `router.ts`

*   **Issue:** Large file size and complexity.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Split the routes into multiple files based on feature or domain.
    *   Use dynamic imports (`() => import(...)`) for route components to enable lazy loading.
    *   Create a separate file for navigation guards.

### 4. `stores/__tests__/configuracoes.spec.ts`

*   **Issue:** High complexity.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Follow the same recommendations as for `processos.spec.ts`.
    *   Ensure that each test has a clear and descriptive name.

### 5. `services/subprocessoService.ts`

*   **Issue:** High complexity.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Break down large functions into smaller, single-responsibility functions.
    *   Extract complex business logic into pure functions that can be tested independently.
    *   Use dependency injection to make the service easier to test.
