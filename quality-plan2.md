# Frontend Code Quality Improvement Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a plan to improve the quality of the frontend codebase. The plan is based on the results of a static analysis performed using the Fast TypeScript Analyzer (FTA) tool. The goal is to address the identified issues to make the code more maintainable, readable, and less prone to bugs.

## 2. Summary of Findings

The FTA tool was run on the `frontend/src` directory. The analysis revealed several areas for improvement. The following files were identified as having the highest complexity and lowest scores:

- `views/PainelRecurso.vue`
- `views/SubprocessoDetalhe.vue`
- `views/ProcessoDetalhe.vue`
- `stores/main.ts`
- `stores/subprocesso.ts`
- `router/index.ts`
- `services/processoService.ts`
- `components/Modal.vue`

Common issues observed across these files include:

- **High Cyclomatic Complexity**: Large components and functions with complex conditional logic.
- **Large File Size**: Components and stores with a large number of lines of code, indicating a violation of the single responsibility principle.
- **Poor Halstead Metrics**: High scores in Halstead metrics indicate that the code is difficult to understand and maintain.
- **Lack of Typing**: Several files have missing or inconsistent type definitions.

## 3. Action Plan

The following is a prioritized list of actions to be taken to improve the code quality.

### 3.1. Refactor High-Complexity Views

**Files to be addressed**:
- `views/PainelRecurso.vue`
- `views/SubprocessoDetalhe.vue`
- `views/ProcessoDetalhe.vue`

**Actions**:
1.  **Break down large components**: Decompose these view components into smaller, more manageable child components. For example, the different sections of the detail pages can be extracted into their own components.
2.  **Simplify template logic**: Reduce the amount of logic in the Vue templates by moving it to computed properties or methods in the script section.
3.  **Use Vue's `script setup`**: Migrate to the `script setup` syntax to improve code organization and readability.
4.  **Add types for props and events**: Ensure all components have clear and consistent type definitions for their props and emitted events.

### 3.2. Refactor Stores

**Files to be addressed**:
- `stores/main.ts`
- `stores/subprocesso.ts`

**Actions**:
1.  **Separate concerns**: The `main.ts` store seems to have multiple responsibilities. It should be broken down into more specific stores (e.g., `authStore`, `uiStore`).
2.  **Simplify actions**: The actions in the stores should be simplified and delegate complex business logic to services.
3.  **Improve state management**: Ensure the state is normalized and that mutations are predictable.
4.  **Add comprehensive tests**: Improve the test coverage of the stores to ensure their reliability.

### 3.3. Improve Routing Configuration

**File to be addressed**:
- `router/index.ts`

**Actions**:
1.  **Modularize routes**: The routing configuration should be split into multiple files, one for each feature or module.
2.  **Use route guards**: Implement navigation guards to handle authentication and authorization logic in a centralized and declarative way.
3.  **Add lazy loading**: Use lazy loading for routes to improve the initial loading performance of the application.

### 3.4. Refactor Services

**File to be addressed**:
- `services/processoService.ts`

**Actions**:
1.  **Single responsibility**: Ensure each service has a single responsibility. If a service is handling too many different tasks, it should be split.
2.  **Error handling**: Implement a consistent error handling strategy for all service methods.
3.  **Dependency injection**: Use a dependency injection mechanism to provide services to the components, which will make the code more modular and testable.

### 3.5. General Improvements

- **Code style**: Enforce a consistent code style using a linter and a formatter (e.g., ESLint and Prettier).
- **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments to all public functions and components to improve the developer experience.
- **Remove unused code**: Regularly run a tool to identify and remove unused code.

By following this plan, we can significantly improve the quality of the frontend codebase, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.
