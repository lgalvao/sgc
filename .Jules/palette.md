## 2024-03-24 - [Reusing EmptyState for Table Views]
**Learning:** Tables often have awkward "No records found" rows (`<tr><td colspan="...">...</td></tr>`) that are visually distinct from other empty states in the application. Replacing these with the standardized `EmptyState` component (placed outside the table or replacing the table body) provides a much more cohesive and visually pleasing experience. It also ensures consistent iconography and messaging across the app.
**Action:** When encountering a table that might be empty, check if `EmptyState` component can be used instead of a custom table row, potentially by conditionally rendering the table vs. the empty state container.
