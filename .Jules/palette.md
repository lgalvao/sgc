**Learning:** The application uses default BootstrapVue tables which result in plain text "No records found" messages. This is a pattern across multiple dashboard components.
**Action:** Enhance empty states with large icons (Bootstrap Icons) and helpful context/call-to-action text to make the "zero data" state feel intentional and less broken.
