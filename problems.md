# Analysis of Issues Encountered

This document outlines the series of interconnected problems that prevented the successful execution of the backend application.

## 1. Initial Blocker: Docker Image Pull Failure

The primary request was to resolve an issue preventing the backend from running via `docker-compose`.

- **Symptom:** The `docker compose up` command failed consistently.
- **Root Cause:** The environment has an unauthenticated pull rate limit for Docker Hub. This prevented the required `postgres:15-alpine` image from being downloaded. This is an environmental constraint, not a bug in the code.

## 2. Core Problem: Obscured Gradle Configuration

To bypass the Docker issue, the strategy shifted to running the backend locally using the Gradle wrapper (`./gradlew :backend:bootRun`). This revealed a series of deeply-rooted and non-obvious issues within the project's Gradle configuration that made local execution impossible.

### 2.1. Symptom: Silent and Skipped Task Execution

When attempting to run the application, the `bootRun` task would either be marked as "SKIPPED" or would appear to run but exit silently without starting the application server or producing any logs. This made debugging extremely difficult.

### 2.2. Root Cause Analysis: A Cascade of Misconfigurations

The silent failures were caused by a combination of three settings across three different Gradle configuration files, which created a "perfect storm" of misdirection:

1.  **Suppressed Logging (`gradle.properties`):**
    - The line `org.gradle.logging.level=quiet` in `gradle.properties` globally suppressed all logging output from Gradle. This hid the critical error messages that would have explained why the application was failing to start.

2.  **Aggressive Configuration Caching (`gradle.properties` & `settings.gradle.kts`):**
    - `org.gradle.configuration-cache=true` in `gradle.properties`.
    - `enableFeaturePreview("STABLE_CONFIGURATION_CACHE")` in `settings.gradle.kts`.
    - This combination created a highly aggressive caching layer that prevented any changes to the build scripts (`build.gradle.kts`) from being recognized. Fixes were applied, but the cached, broken configuration was used on subsequent runs, leading to a frustrating debugging loop where the build refused to update.

3.  **Disabled `bootRun` Task (root `build.gradle.kts`):**
    - The root `build.gradle.kts` file contained a block that explicitly disabled the `bootRun` task for all subprojects:
      ```kotlin
      tasks.withType<org.springframework.boot.gradle.tasks.run.BootRun> {
          isEnabled = false
      }
      ```
    - This was the ultimate reason the application never started, as the `bootRun` task was always skipped, a fact that was hidden by the suppressed logging.

## Conclusion

The inability to run the backend was not a single issue, but a chain reaction. The environmental Docker pull limit forced a fallback to local execution, which was then completely blocked by a deeply misconfigured Gradle setup designed for silence and aggressive caching. The resolution required identifying and disabling these three conflicting settings across `gradle.properties`, `settings.gradle.kts`, and the root `build.gradle.kts` to restore normal, predictable build behavior.
