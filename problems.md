# E2E Test Timeout Issue

## Problem

The E2E tests are consistently timing out, preventing any tests from running to completion. This appears to be caused by a communication failure between the frontend and backend during the test execution.

## Debugging Steps Taken

1.  **Corrected Vite Proxy Port:** The `vite.config.js` file was updated to proxy API requests to port `10000`, matching the backend's configured port.
2.  **Removed Timeouts from Playwright Config:** As an initial test, all timeouts were removed from `playwright.config.ts`. This did not resolve the issue.
3.  **Manual Server Startup:** The backend and frontend servers were started manually to ensure they were running before the E2E tests were executed. This also resulted in a timeout.
4.  **Process Management:** Confirmed that there were no orphaned processes running on the required ports (10000 and 5173) before running the tests.

## Conclusion

Despite these efforts, the E2E tests continue to time out. This suggests a deeper configuration or environmental issue that is preventing the frontend and backend from communicating effectively within the test environment.
