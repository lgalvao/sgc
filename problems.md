# E2E Test and Frontend Server Issues

## Summary

The primary goal of running all test suites (backend, frontend unit, frontend E2E) could not be fully completed due to a persistent issue causing the frontend development server to hang. While the backend and frontend unit tests all pass, the E2E tests are blocked by this server problem.

## Problems Identified and Actions Taken

### 1. Backend `data.sql` Inconsistencies (FIXED)

*   **Problem:** The initial E2E test failures were caused by errors on the backend, which were traced to an inconsistent `data.sql` seeding script. The script was missing key data, had incorrect foreign key references, and used invalid enum values (`RAIZ` for `TipoUnidade`).
*   **Action Taken:** The `data.sql` script was completely rewritten to provide a clean, consistent, and valid dataset for the test environment.
*   **Status:** This issue is resolved. The backend tests pass, and the backend server now starts and runs correctly with the new data.

### 2. Frontend E2E Test Runner Timeouts (UNRESOLVED)

*   **Problem:** The `npm run test:e2e` command consistently times out without completing.
*   **Investigation:**
    *   Initially, the problem was believed to be a misconfigured Vite proxy or an issue with managing the backend server process. These were corrected, but the timeouts persisted.
    *   Further investigation isolated the root cause: the `npm run dev` command, which starts the Vite development server, hangs indefinitely and never becomes ready. The E2E tests time out because they are waiting for this server to start.
    *   Attempts to debug the Vite startup process using `npm run dev -- --debug` also resulted in a timeout, providing no useful logs.
    *   Simplifying the `vite.config.js` by removing the `test` configuration block was attempted as a diagnostic step, but this also did not resolve the hanging issue.

## Root Cause

The fundamental issue is that the **Vite development server (`npm run dev`) fails to start**. The reason for this failure is unknown, as even debugging commands are timing out. This prevents the Playwright E2E test suite from running.

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1.  **Deep Dive into Vite Configuration:** The `vite.config.js` and its imported dependencies (`@vitejs/plugin-vue`, `vite-tsconfig-paths`) should be investigated for potential version incompatibilities or misconfigurations that could cause an infinite loop or hang during startup.
2.  **Dependency Audit:** An audit of the frontend `package.json` dependencies should be performed. There may be a known issue with one of the packages that is affecting the Vite server.
3.  **Local Reproduction:** The issue should be reproduced in a local development environment outside of this tool's sandbox to see if more informative error messages are produced.
