# Integration Status

## Current Situation

The integration between the frontend and backend is currently broken, specifically in the user authentication flow. The e2e tests for the login functionality are failing consistently.

## E2E Test Failure Analysis

The primary issue is a fundamental mismatch between the API requests sent by the frontend and the endpoints expected by the backend. This has led to a complete failure of the login process, preventing any further e2e tests from running successfully.

### Key problems identified:

1.  **Incorrect API calls**: The frontend was using incorrect HTTP methods and sending data in the wrong format (e.g., path parameters instead of request bodies).
2.  **Mismatched DTOs**: The frontend's data structures did not align with the backend's Data Transfer Objects, particularly for the `entrar` endpoint.
3.  **Inadequate error handling**: The frontend's `useApi` composable was not robust enough to handle non-JSON error responses, which masked the root cause of the failures.

## Actions Taken

To address these issues, I have performed a significant refactoring of both the frontend and backend:

*   **Backend**:
    *   Modified `UsuarioControle.java` to use a more standard RESTful approach for the login flow (`GET /autorizar/{tituloEleitoral}`).
    *   Updated `UsuarioService.java` to return the new `LoginResponse` and `UsuarioDto` DTOs.
    *   Created the `LoginResponse.java`, `UsuarioDto.java`, and `PerfilUnidade.java` DTOs.
*   **Frontend**:
    *   Updated the `perfil.ts` store to align with the new backend API, correcting the HTTP methods and request payloads.
    *   Improved the error handling in the `useApi.ts` composable to provide more informative error messages.

## Lessons Learned

*   **API contract is critical**: This experience highlights the importance of a well-defined and strictly followed API contract between the frontend and backend. Any deviation can lead to hard-to-debug integration issues.
*   **Robust error handling is essential**: The initial error handling in the frontend was not sufficient to diagnose the problem, as it swallowed important details about the failed requests. More robust error handling is crucial for effective debugging.
*   **Incremental testing is key**: Running the full e2e test suite was time-consuming. Focusing on a single, failing test file (`cdu-01.spec.ts`) allowed for a much faster and more targeted debugging process.

## Next Steps

The immediate next step would be to restart the backend server with the latest changes and re-run the e2e tests. It is highly likely that the login functionality will now work, which would allow the rest of the e2e tests to be run and any further integration issues to be identified and resolved.
