# Agent Instructions

Before starting any task, it is crucial to understand the architecture and design patterns of the SGC backend. The project contains several `README.md` files that provide this information.

Please read the following documents to get a comprehensive overview:

*   `backend/README.md`: Provides a high-level overview of the backend module.
*   Package-specific READMEs: Each core package in `backend/src/main/java/sgc/` contains a `README.md` that details its specific responsibilities, architecture, and key components.

To get a list of all package-specific READMEs, you can run:
`find backend/src/main/java/sgc -name "README.md"`

Reading these files will ensure your work aligns with the project's established conventions and architectural principles.
