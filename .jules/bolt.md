## 2024-05-23 - Review Feedback False Positive on Missing Method
**Learning:** The code review bot flagged a "missing repository method" as a blocking issue, even though the method (`findByMapaCodigoWithConhecimentos`) was already present in `AtividadeRepo.java`. This happened because the review bot might not have re-read the repository file after I confirmed it existed, or it was checking a diff that didn't include the repository file (since I didn't modify it, I just used it).
**Action:** When a review claims a file or method is missing, double-check the file content using `read_file`. If it exists, the review might be based on incomplete context (e.g., only seeing modified files). Proceed if you are certain the code compiles.
