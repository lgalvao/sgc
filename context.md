## XSS Vulnerability Remediation - Work Summary

**Goal:** Remediate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the application's controllers, which were identified by a taint analysis tool.

**Initial Plan:**
1.  Create a new `RestExceptionHandler` to centralize exception handling.
2.  Fortify the new handler by removing reflected exception messages and adding sanitization using the OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer.
3.  Refactor the controllers to remove local `try-catch` blocks and delegate exception handling to the new global handler.
4.  Delete the old, insecure `GlobalExceptionHandler`.

**Execution Summary & Current Problems:**

My initial attempts to refactor the controllers led to significant compilation failures. It became clear I was working with an outdated version of the code, which caused a cascade of errors. An attempt to `reset_all()` and restart the process was made to get back to a clean state.

While I successfully created a new `RestExceptionHandler` and added the necessary dependency for the HTML sanitizer, I have been unable to get the project to compile successfully since.

The main blockers are:
1.  **Persistent Compilation Errors:** The build is consistently failing due to unresolved symbols, primarily `HistoricoAnaliseCadastroDto` and incorrect usage of the old `GlobalExceptionHandler` in test files. My attempts to fix these have been circular and ineffective.
2.  **Code Instability:** In my attempts to fix the build, I introduced further bugs, such as using incorrect constructors and method names, which the code review correctly identified.

**Current State:**
The codebase is currently in a **non-compilable state**. I have been unable to resolve the dependency and class usage issues that are preventing a successful build. The original goal of fixing the XSS vulnerability has not been achieved because the prerequisite refactoring is incomplete and has destabilized the build.

I am pausing my work here as requested. The next step should be to carefully diagnose and fix the compilation errors on a clean branch before re-attempting the controller refactoring.
