## Context for CDU-08 Integration Test

This document outlines the progress made and the current state of the integration test for **CDU-08: Manter cadastro de atividades e conhecimentos**.

### Goal

The primary objective was to create a comprehensive integration test suite for the CDU-08 use case, using `CDU07IntegrationTest.java` and `guia-testes-integracao.md` as references.

### Work Completed

1.  **`CDU08IntegrationTest.java` Created:**
    *   A new integration test class was created at `backend/src/test/java/sgc/CDU08IntegrationTest.java`.
    *   The test covers the full lifecycle of activities and knowledge, including:
        *   Creation, editing, and deletion.
        *   A complex import scenario from another finalized process.
        *   Validation, security, and edge case scenarios.

2.  **Application Code Refactoring and Bug Fixes:**
    *   The process of writing the integration test revealed several issues and missing pieces in the main application code, which have been addressed:
        *   **`Unidade.java` & `Processo.java`:** Added constructors to simplify test data creation.
        *   **`AtividadeControle.java`:**
            *   Implemented logic to cascade deletes of `Conhecimento` entities when an `Atividade` is deleted.
            *   Added validation to prevent creating activities for a `Subprocesso` that is in a finalized state.
            *   Added authorization checks.
        *   **`SubprocessoRepo.java`:** Added the `findByMapaCodigo` method.
        *   **`SituacaoSubprocesso.java`:** Added an `isFinalizado()` helper method.

3.  **Documentation Update:**
    *   The `guia-testes-integracao.md` file was updated with new patterns and best practices discovered while creating the test, such as using `@Nested` classes for better organization.

4.  **Unit Test Fixes (`AtividadeControleTest.java`):**
    *   The existing unit tests for `AtividadeControle` were broken by the addition of new repository dependencies. These tests have been fixed by providing the necessary mock beans (`@MockBean`).

### Current Status & Remaining Issues

The test suite is nearly complete, but a few stubborn tests are still failing. The debugging process has been complex due to interactions between the Spring test context, security configurations, and transaction management across different test types (`@SpringBootTest` vs. `@WebMvcTest`).

**Remaining Failing Tests in `CDU08IntegrationTest`:**

1.  `naoDevePermitirAcessoUsuarioNaoAutorizado()`: Fails with a 400 or 422 error instead of the expected 403 Forbidden, indicating an issue with how the test security context is interacting with the controller's validation logic.
2.  `deveImportarAtividadesEConhecimentos()`: Fails with a 500 Internal Server Error, pointing to a problem within the `SubprocessoService.importarAtividades` logic that is not immediately obvious from the test setup.
3.  `deveEditarConhecimento()`: Fails with a 400 Bad Request, suggesting the payload for the update request is incorrect, but the exact cause is still under investigation.
4.  `deveAdicionarNovoConhecimento()`: Fails with a `TransientPropertyValueException`, indicating a problem with saving entities that have unsaved dependencies within the test's transaction.

Despite these issues, the created test and the fixes to the main application represent significant progress. The remaining failures likely require a deeper dive into the Spring testing framework's behavior.
